AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```


## What this project does ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

```http
1. WHEN user search for a city
 THEN I will be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

2. WHEN viewing current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.

3. WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

4. WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

5. WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
